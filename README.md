Utilizing this assignment, I derived a good understanding about scopes in Javascript. 
<ol>
<li>A variable that is declared but not assigned a value is undefined, this can be seen in the console log.</li>
<li>Javascript utilizes hoisting, which means that variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase.</li>
<li>This means that you can use a variable or function before it is declared in the code.</li>
<li>A variable that is declared outside of any function is a global variable and can be accessed anywhere in the script.</li>
<li>A variable that is declared inside a function is local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of it.</li>
<li>A variable that is declared with the var keyword is function-scoped, meaning it can be accessed anywhere within the function in which it was declared. </li>
</ol>
